# ADR for Kavosh Project
## Status: Approved
### Context
The Kavosh project requires a client-side scripting language to create interactive web pages. JavaScript is a popular choice, but other options like TypeScript and CoffeeScript are also available. The development team needs to decide on a scripting language to use for the project.

## Decision
We will use JavaScript as the primary client-side scripting language for the Kavosh project. This decision is based on the following factors:
* Wide browser support
* Large community of developers
* Extensive libraries and frameworks available
* Easy integration with other technologies

## Consequences
The consequences of this decision are:
* Faster development time due to the large number of available libraries and frameworks
* Easier maintenance and debugging due to the wide use of JavaScript
* Potential performance issues if not optimized properly
* Need for additional tools and libraries to support modern JavaScript features
